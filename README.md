# **Student Performance - EDA and Visualization**

This repository contains the code and data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student performance. The EDA is done using Python and the Jupyter notebook environment.

## Data
The data for this EDA is stored in the [data folder](https://github.com/prathmeshdesai1996/Student-Performance---EDA-and-Visualization/tree/main/data), in a [CSV format](https://github.com/prathmeshdesai1996/Student-Performance---EDA-and-Visualization/blob/main/data/StudentsPerformance.csv). The data contains information on student performance in different subjects.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- `Python 3`
- `Jupyter notebook`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`

You can install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
